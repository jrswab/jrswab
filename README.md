# Hi, I'm Jaron 👋
I'm a senior software engineer crafting software to increase developer productivity, provide cost-effective solutions for small businesses, and bring back the optimistic day dreams of the future.

My coding journey started over 20 years ago when I was invited to join the advanced computer class offered at my high school. From then on, I've been dedicated to creating tools and software to solve the problems around me.

By specializing in Go, CLI, and progressive web applications, I create solutions not only for myself but for businesses looking for fast, customizable solutions.

For myself and other developers, it's about creating tools to enhance our productivity. For businesses, it's about creating the exact solution to their needs. Doing so in a way that doesn't require the cost of a full software team.

I believe software should solve problems in ways that honor God and are a net benefit to society. You can learn more about how I view software, the industry, and productivity as a Christian software engineer through my [blog content](https://jrswab.com/blog/).
